            <h2>Over the years</h2>
            <p>Having been an active participant in various sports such as football, netball, and volleyball, i have gained experiences and opportunities i never thought i'd have. At an early age, the exposure to a very sports encourgaed environment has helped me build my character and love around physical activity. From the involvement in almost every sports team at school, to my participation in the U13, U15 and U19 BSME games - a tournament involving british schools from all aorund the middle east, competing in atheltics,football and netball. I have been able to demonstrate my leadership and communication skills, especially most recently as i captained my football team both during the ADDISA season and U19 BSME games.  </p>

            <h2>My experience</h2>
            <p> Representing my school in such comeptitions have been a significant highlight in my sporting journey. Along with this, it has taught me the value of teamwork, responsiblity, and perseverance. <br><br>
                I have been able to implement these skills in my ongoing coach assiting position, where i have helped set out drills, and lead younger teams during their netball training, working on techniques and matchplay. I have thoroughly enjoyed taking this up, as well as my involvement and help in P.E lessons ranging from FS1 - year 2. This exposure to a new environment helped me step out of my comfort zone and take charge in various ways, whether it be by finding ways for many 4 year old ears to listen or set up obstacles and activites.
