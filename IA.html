                <h2>My experience</h2>
                <p>Having to take up a skill, service and physical activity, The international award of Edinburgh encouraged me to stay consitent with my fitness as well as sign language to reach my end goal. I was able to expand my experiences through my voluntary services over several months, helping out in many community events, races and activities. This helped me improve my communication skills as well the introduction to many new people. However, what i found to be the most exciting part of completing both my bronze and silver award, was the expedition. Going on a 3 day trip for my silver award, we were able to work as a team, hiking up to 50km over the 3 days, navigating routes using maps to reach stop points and the campsite, setting up tents and cooking our food. Although we faced some difficulties due to the extreme heat and distance uphill and on flat land, i would consider our technique and hiking pace as a group of 6 as extremely efficient, getting us to all our final spots the fastest out of everyone, with more than enough time for us to set up and enjoy the rest of the night! <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, i would say it has been one of the best experiences so far, from cooking pasta everynight to facing some challenges with my friends i thought i'd never face - remember, there were no toilets! <br>
                <br>
